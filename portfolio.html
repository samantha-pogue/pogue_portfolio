      <h4>WRIT 4662 Writing with Digital Technologies</h4>
      <p>I made a static website for my client, the Curling Club at the University of Minnesota. The site was made using HTML and
        an external style sheet, w3.css. Prior to this assignment, I was very familiar with HTML, but I had to learn how to
        incorporate CSS.
        Later on, I went back to this site to make it more mobile friendly, since many students could be accessing the site through their phones

      <h4>WRIT 4662 Writing with Digital Technologies</h4>
      <p>For this assignment, I had to learn about structured authoring and information architecture.
        Using XML, I structured information for the curling club regarding their bonspiels.
        At the start, I figured this project would be easier, since XML is simpler to learn than HTML.
        However,the more challenging part was learning how to structure the information.

      <h4>WRIT 4662 Writing with Digital Technologies</h4>
      <p>Using DITA in the Oxygen XML Editor, I organized the curling club's registration information.
        For this assignment, I had to figure out the best way to organize the information within the framework of DITA,
        which meant I had to learn and understand how DITA works. I used the DITA structure to create a help website with a DITA template.

      <h4>WRIT 3671 Visual Rhetoric & Document Design</h4>
      <p>Our final project for Visual Rhetoric and Document design was to create a project using the principles of design used in class.
        I created a magazine spread, focusing on creating a minimalist design as well as alignment, font, and use of white space.

      <h4>WRIT 3562W Technical & Professional Writing</h4>
      <p>This course introduced many different forms of formal writings that I might encounter in the workplace.
        For this final formal report, I had to collect and evaluate research on the topic of mental health and music therapy,
         then compile my findings into a structured report.

      <h4>WRIT 3562W Technical & Professional Writing</h4>
      <p>Before we could start writing our formal report, we had to write a proposal and have it approved by our instructor.
        This assignment had us create a project plan, explain why the topic was important, and annotate relevant sources.
