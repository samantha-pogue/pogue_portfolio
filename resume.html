        <h2>SKILLS & ABILITIES</h2>
        <h3>Web Content Writing</h3>
        <p>Through learning about writing in a digital space as well as applying it while working on the digital team at the Carlson School,
          I have learned how to tailor my writing for the web. I have worked with writing content for websites as well as social media posts and advertisements.
        </p>
        <h3>Digital Literacy</h3>
        <p>I have learned to use several different programs while in college, but more importantly,
          I've acquired the skill of knowing how to learn a new technology and apply it to what I am trying to accomplish.
        </p>
        <h3>Oral & Written Communication</h3>
        <p>The classes in my major have taught me how to use multiple different mediums of communication, such as written, oral, and communication in digital spaces.
          Communication involves knowing your audience and tailoring to them, making sure to get your message across.
        </p>
        <h3>Editing</h3>
        <p>After taking an editing course, I started working as a proofreader at the Carlson School of Management.
          There, I edited news stories, social media posts, advertisements, and webpages.
          I was able to hone in on my grammar, as well as address higher level concerns such as coherency.
